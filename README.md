# JOTAI MEETUP - React JS GÃ¶teborg - 20211103

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

### Concepts

The purpose of this demo was to show how you can reduce over re-rendering with the use of the Jotai state library.

Theres three Counter components that have different state strategies with Count3 being the final Jotai example.

I only scratch on the surface of the Jotai API but cover the following in `count-atom`:

1. useAtom
2. selectAtom
3. focusAtom
4. computed state
